"""If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
{a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

# Euclid's formula for finding Pythagorean triples states that every triple is uniquely determined by integers m,n,k such that

# a = k(m^2-n^2)
# b = k(2mn)
# c = k(m^2 + n^2)
#
# Since 0 < a,b < c, it follows that
#
# c > 2
#
# m > n > 0 (as m,n < 0 yield the same triple as |m|,|n|)
#
# and
#
# k > 0. 
#
# The triple of smallest perimeter is (3,4,5), with perimeter 12, so k is bounded by 1000/12 < 84.
# Also, the largest possible size for b is 333, so n < (333/2)^.5 < 13. In summary:
#
# 0 < k 
# 0 < n < m < 1000^.5 < 32
